This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Todo

1. local storage management by `apollo-link-state` instead of `redux` and `redux-saga`
2. testing by `@apollo/react-testing`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `@testing-library/react`

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
